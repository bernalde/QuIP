    "### Applications\n",
    "The Gröbner bases method is an attractive tool in computer algebra and symbolic mathematics because it is relatively simple to understand and it can be applied to a wide variety of problems in mathematics and engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider a set $F$ of multivariate polynomial equations over a field:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "F = \\{ f \\in \\mathrm{K}[x_1, \\ldots, x_n] \\}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A Gröbner basis $G$ of $F$ with respect to a fixed ordering of monomials is another set of polynomial equations with certain nice properties that depend on the choice of the order of monomials and variables. $G$ will be structurally different from $F$, but has exactly the same set of solutions.\n",

    "#### Vertex $k$-coloring of graphs \n",
    "Given a graph $\\mathcal{G}(V, E)$, where $V$ is the set of vertices and $E$ is the set of edges of $\\mathcal{G}$, and a positive integer $k$, we ask if it is possible to assign a color to every vertex from $V$, such that adjacent vertices have different colors assigned. Moreover, if graph $\\mathcal{G}$ is $k$–colorable, we would like to enumerate all possible $k$–colorings this graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will solve this problem using the Gröbner bases method. First of all, we have to transform this graph–theoretical definition of $k$–coloring problem into a form that is understandable by the Gröbner bases machinery. This means we have to construct a system of polynomial equations that embeds the structure of a graph and constraints related to the $k$–coloring problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start by assigning a variable to each vertex. Given that $\\mathcal{G}$ has $n$ vertices, i.e. $|V| = n$, then we will introduce variables $x_1, \\ldots, x_n$. Next we will write a set of equations describing the fact that we allow assignment of one of $k$ possible colors to each vertex. The best approach currently known is to map colors to the $k$–th roots of unity, which are the solutions to the equation $x^k - 1 = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $\\zeta = \\exp(\\frac{2\\pi\\mathrm{i}}{k})$ be a $k$–th root of unity. We map the colors $1, \\ldots, k$ to $1, \\zeta, \\ldots, \\zeta^{k-1}$. Then the statement that every vertex has to be assigned one of $k$ colors is equivalent to writing the following set of polynomial equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_k = \\{ x_i^k - 1 = 0 : i = 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\}$$\n",
    "We also require that two adjacent vertices $x_i$ and $x_j$ are assigned different colors. From the previous discussion we know that $x_i^k = 1$ and $x_j^k = 1$, so $x_i^k = x_j^k$ or, equivalently, $x_i^k - x_j^k = 0$. By factorization we obtain that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x_i^k - x_j^k = (x_i - x_j) \\cdot f(x_i, x_j) = 0$$\n",
    "where $f(x_i, x_j)$ is a bivariate polynomial of degree $k-1$ in both variables. Since we require that $x_i \\not= x_j$ then $x_i^k - x_j^k$ can vanish only when $f(x_i, x_j) = 0$. This allows us to write another set of polynomial equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$F_{\\mathcal{G}} = \\{ f(x_i, x_j) = 0 : (i, j) \\in E \\}$$\n",
    "Next we combine $F_k$ and $F_{\\mathcal{G}}$ into one system of equations $F$. The graph $\\mathcal{G}(V, E)$ is $k$-colorable if the Gröbner basis $G$ of $F$ is non-trivial, i.e., $G \\not= \\{1\\}$. If this is not the case, then the graph isn’t $k$–colorable. Otherwise the Gröbner basis gives us information about all possible $k$–colorings of $\\mathcal{G}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s now focus on a particular $k$–coloring where $k = 3$. In this case:\n",
