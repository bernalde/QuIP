# gh-syllabus

A template for a [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) hosted syllabus.

- See the [live site](https://jan-martinek.github.io/gh-syllabus/) generated from this repo.
- See the code in the [`master` branch](https://github.com/jan-martinek/gh-syllabus/tree/gh-pages).
- Fork/clone this repository and make your own course syllabus on Github Pages.

## Syllabi based on this template

- [Kritická teorie a inovace: kde jsme a co s tím?](https://jan-martinek.github.io/ktai2017/) ([repo](https://github.com/jan-martinek/ktai2017))
- [Introduction To Digital Humanities For The Ancient World](https://isaw-ga-3024.github.io/isaw-dh-syllabus/) ([repo](https://github.com/isaw-ga-3024/isaw-dh-syllabus))

## Five step setup

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) this repository.
2. [Enable GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages/#enabling-github-pages-to-publish-your-site-from-master-or-gh-pages) to publish your site from `master` branch. 
3. **It should work by now.** Check link to the live website right the in the settings.
4. Edit `config.yml` and `*.md` files in `_syllabus` and this folder to add any content you want.
5. Replace contents of this `README` file with description of your syllabus.

## Tips

- The syntax is mostly in easily readable [Markdown](http://markdown-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html). 
- Config file is YAML, but may easily see it as `name: value` list (it works most of the time like this). 
- You may use [Github's own editor](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/) to edit or add any of the files in repository.
- Template is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) static site generator (that is used by Github Pages). So if you want to dig deeper, you can change almost anything (visuals, content structure, etc.).
