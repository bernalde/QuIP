- This is a **template of a course syllabus microsite** based on Jekyll/Github Pages. (Licensed under MIT: use at will!)
- See [a live example of a syllabus](http://jan-martinek.github.io/ktai.peerb/) in the wild.
- Clone [the repository](https://github.com/jan-martinek/gh-syllabus) and do your magic! 
- Only basic HTML/Markdown and Github knowledge is needed.
	- Website contents are in the `gh-pages` branch (read more about [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com)). 
	- Github automagically generates a nice website at `http://your-username.github.io/repository-name/`.
	- Edit the `something.md` files in the root folder and unit descriptions in `_syllabus/`.
