Tuesdays and Thursdays 5:20p.m. - 7:10p.m. EST. Lectures on Zoom.

Prof. Sridhar Tayur (4216 Tepper Quad), Dr. Davide Venturelli (online), David Bernal (DH3116).

## Objectives

This course is primarily designed for graduate students (and advanced undergraduates) across CMU campuses interested in integer programming (with non-linear objective functions) and the potential of near-term quantum computing for solving combinatorial optimization problems.
By the end of the semester, someone enrolled in this course should be able to:
- Identify the current status of quantum computing and its potential uses for integer programming
- Access and use quantum computing resources (such as DWave Quantum Annealers)
- Set up a given integer program to be solved with quantum computing 
- Work in groups collaboratively on a state-of-the-art project regarding applications of quantum computing and integer programming

This course is not going to focus on the following topics:
- Quantum Gates and Circuits
- Computational complexity theory
- Quantum Information Theory
- Analysis of speedup using differential geometry, algebraic topology, etc.

Students with backgrounds in operations research, industrial engineering, chemical engineering, electrical engineering, physics, computer science, or applied mathematics are strongly encouraged to consider taking this course.

## Prerequisite classes and capabilities

Although this class has no explicit prerequisites we consider a list of recommended topics and skills that the student should feel comfortable with.
An undergraduate-level understanding of probability, calculus, statistics, graph theory, algorithms, and linear algebra is assumed.
Knowledge of linear and integer programming will be useful for this course.
Programming skills are strongly recommended.
Basic concepts in physics are recommended but lack of prior knowledge is not an issue as pertinent ones will be covered in the lectures.
No particular knowledge in quantum mechanics or algebraic geometry is required.


## Basic course structure

**Week 1:** Integer programming classical methods.

**Week 2:** Ising model, Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization.

**Week 3:** Graver Augmented Multiseed algorithm (GAMA).

**Week 4:** Quantum methods for solving Ising/QUBO.

**Week 5:** Specialized hardware methods for solving Ising/QUBO.

**Week 6:** Applications and final project presentations.


## Grading
Weekly homework and quizzes (50%), Final Project (50%).
- Each lecture will have a short quiz to evaluate the concepts covered in class. The  two worst quizzes won't be counted towards the final grade.
- The final project will be submitted in groups and it will require the implementation and solution of an integer programming instance using quantum computing resources. This final project deliverable will be a report and a presentation.

## Highlights
- Development of this course was supported by the Air Force Research Lab NYSTEC-USRA Contract (FA8750-19-3-6101)
- Access to D-Wave systems might be available via written proposals to the University Space Research Association (USRA). See [RIACS website](https://riacs.usra.edu/quantum/rfp) for terms and conditions. The course will discuss proposal preparation.
- Students of this course are encouraged to apply to the [Feynman Academy Internship program](https://riacs.usra.edu/quantum/qacademy) that sponsors research projects at NASA Ames Research Center.
