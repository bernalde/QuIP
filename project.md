The final project accounts for 50% of the total grade.
This project will be completed in groups of 3-4 students and will reflect the understanding of the students of the material covered in the lecture.

The components of this project are the following
- Identify a problem that can be posed as an Integer Program. Discuss the importance of this problem.
- Solve instances of the identifies problem using classical tools. Identify which are the sources of complexity while solving this problem.
- Model the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Verify that the reformulation of the problem is valid, in the sense that it represents the original problem.
- Solve the resulting QUBO using non-conventional methods, e.g. Quantum Annealing, QAOA, simulated annealing in GPUs/TPUs, etc. Compare at least two different methods.
- Write a report outlining the different approaches used and highlighting the knowledge obtained while developing the project.
- Hold a final presentation in front of the class reporting the findings of the project.
